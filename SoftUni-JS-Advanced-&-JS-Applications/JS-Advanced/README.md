# SoftUni-JS-Advanced

During the "JS Advanced" course we gained in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects ,classes and writing functions. We studied more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding and event loop. We learned about the DOM, DOM manipulations and events. We had first glance on what OOP and functional programming paradigms are and learned about the concepts of inheritance, object composition and prototype chain.

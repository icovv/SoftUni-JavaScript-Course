# SoftUni-JS-Applications

During the "JS Applications" course we learned about HTTP, HTTP requests and how to use them. We gained knowledge on what REST Services are, what Baas(back-end as a service) is, how to work with both REST and Baas and what asynchronous code is (Promises, async/await). We learned about Templating and Routing and also how to create a Single Page Application. By the end of the course we learned what the architecture of our application should look like and also how to create our own Web Components from scratch.

            <h2>Three laws of robotics</h2>
            <p>Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who </br> sought to create an ethical system for humans and robots.</p>

            <div class="items">
                <h3>1st Law</h3>
                <p>A robot may not injure a human being or,</br> through inaction, allow a human being to come</br> to harm</p>
            </div>
            <div class="items">
                <h3>2nd Law</h3>
                <p>A robot must obey the orders given it by human</br> beings except where such orders would conflict</br> with the First Law</p>
            </div>
            <div class="items">
                <h3>3rd Law</h3>
                <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long</br> as such protection does not conflict with the</br> First or Second Law</p>
            </div>
        <footer><p>Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated that “a </br> robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”</p></footer>
